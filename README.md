Replace the IP addresses inside the `00-setup-hosts.sh` script with the ones assigned to your VM's, `cp` and `./` the script against it, `less`  `/etc/hosts` for validation    

```bash      
bash 00-setup-hosts.sh      
```     
Similarly, `cp` over the `10-setup-master.sh` and `30-setup-node.sh` onto your Master and `./` the script in a sequence.      
```bash      
bash 10-setup-master.sh      
```      
```bash      
bash 30-setup-node.sh      
```     
**Note:** You'll have to wait until the `setup-master.sh` script completes it execution
